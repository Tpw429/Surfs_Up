## Overview of the Analysis
In this project, I examined weather patterns in Oahu, Hawaii to determine whether the location would be good to open a local surfboard and icecream shop. I sifted through data entries like weather pattens, temperature, and average rainfall to see if this venture would work. To find more accurate data, I even went as far as to narrow my search of average temperature to the radar with the most data displayed. In addition, I broke down even further and dove into temperature ranges for specific months. The results will be explained in the paragraphs to come.
